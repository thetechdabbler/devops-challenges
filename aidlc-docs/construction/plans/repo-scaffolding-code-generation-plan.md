# Code Generation Plan — Unit 1: repo-scaffolding

## Unit Context
- **Unit**: repo-scaffolding
- **Type**: Foundation — must complete before all topic units
- **Commit target**: main branch directly (foundation, no PR needed)

## Steps

- [ ] Step 1: Create `devops-challenges/README.md` — repo overview, topic index, learning path, how to use
- [ ] Step 2: Create `devops-challenges/shared-resources/app/` — Python Flask sample app (app.py, requirements.txt, README.md)
- [ ] Step 3: Create `devops-challenges/shared-resources/README.md` — explain sample app, how it is used across topics
- [ ] Step 4: Create `devops-challenges/solutions/README.md` — explain solutions directory structure
- [ ] Step 5: Create topic README stubs — docker, kubernetes, ci, cd, ansible, iac, observability, aws
- [ ] Step 6: Commit to main and push
