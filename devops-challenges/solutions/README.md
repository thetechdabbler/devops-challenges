## How to Use Solutions

1. **Attempt the challenge first.** Solutions are most valuable after you've struggled with the problem yourself.
2. **Read the reasoning.** Each `step-by-step-solution.md` explains *why* each decision was made, not just the commands to run.
3. **Compare your approach.** Your solution may differ from the one here — that's fine. Use it as a reference, not the only way.

## What Each Solution Contains

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `step-by-step-solution.md` | Full walkthrough with explanations and production tips |
| Working config files | The completed version of any starter files from the challenge |

> **Don't peek too early.** The struggle is where the learning happens.
