# 10 — CI for Pull Requests

**Level**: Advanced | **Topic**: CI

Configure CI to run on PRs, post status checks, comment results, and integrate with GitHub branch protection rules. Five issues to fix.

## Quick Start

```bash
cp starter/ci.yml .github/workflows/ci.yml
# Open a pull request to trigger the workflow
# Fix the 5 issues so the PR gets status checks
# Then configure branch protection to require the check
```

See [`challenge.md`](./challenge.md) for all tasks and acceptance criteria.
